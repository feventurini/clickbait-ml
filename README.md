# Generating Clickbait Titles with Machine Learning

In this project (in PROGRESS) I am exploring RNNs (in particular GRUs and LSTMs) for creating clickbait article titles. As a training dataset, I scraped buzzfeed for titles (because let's be honest, every buzzfeed title is a clickbait title) and trained a simple RNNLM on the data. The RNNLM is then used as a sentence generator to see what the model has learned about clickbait, and maybe creating some realistic and fun examples.
